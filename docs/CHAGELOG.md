This design builds upon prior REFET-based systems and introduces G-FETs as a stable stochastic source, integrated with a photonic quantum core for universal quantum computing applications. The document includes theoretical motivation, comparative selection process, apparatus overview, and experimental validation.Files Added:G FET Based - Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates V1.0 CURRENT.txtG FET Based - Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates V1.0 CURRENT.mdG FET Based - Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates V1.0 CURRENT.pdf\[PUT UP OR SHUT UP: A Minimalist PoC for Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates] — \[v1.0]Author: EmergenceByDesignDate: 2025-10-21Change Type: Initial PublicationAdded a standalone summary of a proposed practical Proof of Concept for the G FET based stochastic logic gates for experimental validation. file added PUT UP OR SHUT UP\_ A Minimalist PoC for Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates V1.0 CURRENT.txtPUT UP OR SHUT UP\_ A Minimalist PoC for Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates V1.0 CURRENT.mdPUT UP OR SHUT UP\_ A Minimalist PoC for Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates V1.0 CURRENT.pdf
