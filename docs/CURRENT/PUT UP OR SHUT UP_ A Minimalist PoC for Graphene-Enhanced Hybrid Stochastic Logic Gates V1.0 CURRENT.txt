PUT UP OR SHUT UP: A Minimalist Proof-of-Concept for Graphene-Enhanced Hybrid Stochastic Logic Gates
Purpose:
 To demonstrate that post-deterministic logic gates using G-FETs and ion chambers can produce reproducible, non-Gaussian stochastic signals suitable for entropy auditing, probabilistic logic, and quantum preprocessing—using only off-the-shelf components, room-temperature operation, and no metaphysical claims.

 Phase 1: Core Signal Demonstration
Objective
Show that a G-FET under DC bias produces 1/f noise distinguishable from Johnson noise, and that this signal can be thresholded into logic outputs.
Materials
Graphenea GFET-S10 or S20 ($150–$300)
NE5532P Op-Amp ($0.69)
Raspberry Pi Pico ($4.00)
Ion Chamber Module (e.g., smoke detector salvage or $100 commercial)
Basic resistors, capacitors, perfboard, shielding (~$20)
Procedure
Mount G-FET on perfboard with stable DC bias (1–10 V).
Amplify output using NE5532P in low-noise configuration.
Mix with ion chamber signal via summing amplifier.
Threshold with comparator to produce binary output.
Log signal using Pico at ≥50 kHz.
Analyze FFT for 1/f slope and heavy-tailed distribution.
Run Diehard tests on thresholded output to verify entropy.
Expected Outcome
Reproducible 1/f noise spectrum from G-FET.
Distinct from white noise baseline.
Thresholded output shows probabilistic toggling.
Entropy metrics exceed pseudorandom generators.

 Phase 2: Hybrid Gate Demonstration
Objective
Show that combining G-FET and ion chamber signals yields a post-deterministic gate with tunable entropy and stable output.
Procedure
Repeat Phase 1 setup with both sources active.
Tune comparator thresholds to adjust gate sensitivity.
Log output over time and compare to single-source gates.
Demonstrate reproducibility across multiple G-FETs.
Expected Outcome
Hybrid signal shows enhanced entropy.
Gate output is stable, reproducible, and tunable.
No need for cryogenics or exotic shielding.

 Phase 3: Quantum Core Interface (Optional)
Objective
Show that stochastic gate output can modulate photonic paths or verify quantum states.
Materials
Beam splitter, phase shifter, SPD (optional, ~$10,000)
Coupling circuit from gate output to photonic modulator
Procedure
Use gate output to trigger photonic path selection.
Demonstrate modulation or verification of quantum states.
Compare entropy profile to known quantum sources.
Expected Outcome
Hybrid gate acts as entropy auditor or preprocessor.
Photonic core responds to stochastic modulation.
Demonstrates scalable path to universal quantum computing.

 Epistemic Position
No extraordinary claims: All phenomena are grounded in known physics.
No metaphysical appeals: Only empirical reproducibility and structural honesty.
No proprietary dependencies: All components are open-market and replicable.
No rhetorical inflation: This is a demonstrator, not a revolution—until it proves itself.
